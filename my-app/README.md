# My Next.js App

This is a Next.js application that has been converted to a static HTML website.

## Development

To run the application in a development environment:

1. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   cd my-app
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Building the Static HTML Version

To build the static HTML version of the application:

1. Make sure you're in the `my-app` directory:
   ```
   cd my-app
   ```
2. Build the static HTML files:
   ```
   npx next build
   ```
3. The static HTML files will be generated in the `my-app/out/` directory.


Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like me to make any further improvements to the project.
